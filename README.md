# Hello, I'm Carlos García Santa

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm a Computer Engineering student at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, where I dive deep into the world of technology, focusing on software development and hardware design. Even though I'm still in the learning phase, I'm passionate about understanding how things work from the ground up, which drives my interest in programming and hardware description languages.

## 💻 About Me

As someone who is exploring the vast field of Computer Engineering, I've developed a keen interest in both software and hardware aspects. My programming skills are primarily in:

- C
- Python
- SQL
- Java
- HTML
- CSS
- ASM (Assembly)
- VHDL

I'm fascinated by the challenge of understanding complex systems and the satisfaction that comes with solving problems through code and design. My academic journey is not just about learning languages; it's about understanding the principles that make our digital world function.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about computer architecture, database management, and web development.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to the languages I'm learning or the projects I'm dreaming up.
